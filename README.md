# Kusama's Corner Pumpkin Light üü®‚ö´
## üöÄ About
Create RGB Kusama pumpkin lamp powered with an ESP32 with menu toggling function built in. This is proof of concept for subsequent project involving making this smart home comptaible either using espressif or homespan via ESP32.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware
### Links to the STL print files
- The following thingiverse contains 3 STL files.

	- Shelled pumpkin would require a lot of support, however is effective to accomodate for walls with inconsistent corners.
	- Hollowed pumpkin requires infill to establish support on the inside of the pumpkin, but can function as a standalone corner lamp. The hollowed pumpkin is used by this project
- The joystick pumpkin is an optional print and is a custom fit print with a complete Yayoi Kusama pumpkin as a joystick cap.

### Hardwares involved
- Neopixel hw160 or any rgb strip (but may require different transistors)
- ESP32 (using Lilygo ESP32 TTGO in this case)
- Joystick
- Breadboard
- Male-to-male header cables
- Button/SDPT switch

### Circuit diagram
- Referring to the ``rgb_led_circuit.fzz`` or the following screenshot, route the hardware as shown above.

## üñ•Ô∏è Software
### Instructions
- Lamp will change white balance based on the nautical twilights, civil twilights, sunrise/sunset, and solar noon. 
- Switch will turn the lamp on and off.

### Instructions to run arduino code
1) Using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), open the respective ``.ino`` file
2) Install [TTGO T-display driver](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO-T-Display)
3) Assign Arduino IDE port to the one that Lilygo TTGO is connected to
4) Install TFT_eSPI library (display library)
	- Under Arduino IDE/tools/library_manager, search ``tft_espi``
	- Navigate to the library, e.g. Documents/Arduino/libraries/tft_espi
	- Open up the file Arduino/libraries/TFT_eSPI/User_Setup_Select.h
	- comment out the line ``#include <User_setup.h>``
	- uncomment out the line include ``<User_Setups/Setup25_TTGO_T_Display.h>>``
	- note - commenting out means adding ``//`` in front of the line, to uncomment, remove ``//`` but don‚Äôt remove the ``#`` sign
5) Install [Adafruit Neopixel](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) under ``Arduino IDE/Library Manager``
6) Install [SPI](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/communication/SPI/) under ``Arduino IDE/Library Manager``
7) Go to ``sunrise-sunset-n-current-time.ino`` and change the wifi name and password to your own wifi name and password.
8) Compile and upload the code from the ``.ino`` to your Lilygo TTGO
9) Money üí∏üí∏üí∏
